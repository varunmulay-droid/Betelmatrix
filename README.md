Betelmatrix: A Vision for Local AI in India
Hey there! Thanks for checking out my project. This is the landing page for Betelmatrix, a concept company I dreamed up to explore how Generative AI could be tailored for small and medium-sized businesses right here in India. Think of it as a passion project to see how high-end design could meet a very local need.

What's This All About?
I've always been fascinated by the idea of empowering local businesses. So, I built Betelmatrix as a fictional company that would create AI agents deeply in tune with the Indian market. The goal was to build a website that felt trustworthy, innovative, and incredibly professional, showing how technology can be both cutting-edge and accessible.

I centered the concept on three core ideas that I believe would matter most to a local business owner:

Worry-Free Compliance: Making sure the tech automatically handles all the tricky local tax and regulatory rules.

Real-World Savings: Designing AI that actually saves money and helps the business grow.

Speaking Your Language: Ensuring the AI works seamlessly in local languages and understands cultural nuance
